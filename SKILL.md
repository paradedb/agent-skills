# ParadeDB Skill

ParadeDB brings Elasticsearch-like full-text search and analytics to PostgreSQL using the `pg_search` extension. It provides BM25 ranking, advanced tokenizers, aggregations, and real-time indexing with ACID compliance.

**Key capabilities:** Full-text search with BM25 relevance scoring, hybrid search (keyword + semantic embeddings via pgvector), fuzzy matching, phrase queries, faceted search, and Tantivy-powered performance.
